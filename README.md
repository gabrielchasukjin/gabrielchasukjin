Hello, I’m a UC San Diego data-science grad (incoming M.S. at [Columbia Engineering](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/)) focused on aligning LLMs with human intent and building agentic AI tools. I’ve built an LLM-powered JupyterLab extension for automated teaching content at the [DSTL Lab](https://lau.ucsd.edu/), slashed data-pipeline latency at [Edison](https://www.edison.com/), and taught 1,200+ undergradautes as a nine-time TA in ML/DS courses.
